# Why

I have a real problem with tabs. Sometimes I have development, staging and production open.
Switching between contexts between testing on development and fielding support on production is a harrowing experience.
The dangermark-extension clearly delineates the sites with an unmissable overlay.

# How to develop
## Requirements
1. `node > 8.10.0`

## Building
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`
1. `npm run web-ext` - Optional: Will start a Firefox browser with the addon installed, only if you choose to develop with Firefox.
